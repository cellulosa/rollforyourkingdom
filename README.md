# Roll for your kingdom

This is the code repository for the browser-based game [rollforyourkingdom.vercel.app](https://rollforyourkingdom.vercel.app/).
The game is an Age of Empires inspired R&W solitary game [invented by my brother in law](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/145017/print-and-play-roll-your-kingdom), so kudos to him for the logic.

## About this project

A little pet project I developed to learn [Svelte](svelte.dev/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and Typescript.
Please note I am not a developer so apologies the silly code. In fact, feel free to improve it - so that I can get better too!

## Packages and technologies

It uses [Zod](https://zod.dev/) and [tRCP](https://trpc.io/) connected to a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) postgres database via [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).
Login is managed via [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/).
The design is built with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [DaisyUI](daisyui.com/), [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/), [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io/) via [steeze-ui/icons](https://github.com/steeze-ui/icons).
Special thanks also to (tRPC-SvelteKit)[https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-sveltekit], (zod-prisma-types)[https://github.com/chrishoermann/zod-prisma-types], (svelte-toast)[https://github.com/zerodevx/svelte-toast] and [party.js](https://party.js.org/).
